Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dennis Valentine
Maintainer: Dennis Valentine <denden.emails@gmail.com>
Description: This is the TidyTrials package. This package is essentially an XML wrapper to extract and tidy trials from ClinicalTrials.Gov. TidyTrials exists because clinical trials have a broad audience but the data is currently inaccessible to researchers who might be unfamiliar with parsing XML files (i.e. statisticians, geneticists and maybe some computational biologists).
